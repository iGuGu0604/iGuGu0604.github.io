Hello, my name is Xing Gao. It's an adjective in Chinese means happy, so luckily, people always say 'Happy to see you' to me the first time we meet.

I graduated from Wuhan University major in Physics, in my senior year, I stayed in UCSB as an exchanged student. It was the year I decided to devote my future into neuroscience!💪🏼 I'm currently a volunteer in SLAB, and seeking to a research assistant position before appling for PhD.
